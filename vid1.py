print("Hello World!")
#prints hello world!
#here print is a function

#Variables in python!
#Variable are names given to memory location in a program
name = "Vishnu"     #here 'name' is  a variable
age = 20

print(name)     #printing using variable name
print(age)

print("My name is: ", name, "and my age is ",age)     #printing using variable name with string

# assigning values to variables
age2 = age
#thus age's value is assigned to age2 variable

#type fucntion: returns type of a variable
print(type(age))    #int
print(type(name))   #str(string)

#printing sum using variables
a=2
b=4
sum = a+b
print(sum)

#assignment operators in python
num = 10
num = num + 2
#now value of num becomes 12 i.e 10 + 2

#this can be simplified using special operator: +=
num1 = 10
num1+=2
print(num1)

#similarly we can also use  -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=, <<=, >>=, &=, ^=
